## 💡 Pro Tips

### Design
1. **Less is More**: Don't overdo animations - be selective
2. **Consistency**: Use your design system religiously
3. **White Space**: Don't be afraid of empty space
4. **Hierarchy**: Make important things BIG
5. **Color**: Use color to guide attention

### Performance
1. **Measure First**: Always establish baseline before optimizing
2. **Test on Slow**: Test on slow 3G to catch real issues
3. **Image Sizes**: Most images can be 50% smaller
4. **Lazy Load**: Everything below the fold
5. **Cache**: Set proper cache headers

### Content
1. **Story First**: Lead with the problem, not the solution
2. **Metrics**: Include specific numbers and results
3. **Visuals**: Show, don't just tell
4. **Testimonials**: Real quotes from real people
5. **CTAs**: Make it obvious what you want users to do

### Accessibility
1. **Keyboard Test**: Navigate entire site with Tab only
2. **Screen Reader**: Test with NVDA or VoiceOver
3. **Color Contrast**: Use WebAIM contrast checker
4. **ARIA**: Use sparingly - semantic HTML first
5. **Focus**: Visible focus indicators on everything

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: I don't have time for all this. What's the minimum?**  
A: Focus on Week 1 priorities (20-25 hours). That alone will get you to ~32-33 points.

**Q: My bundle sizes are too large. Help!**  
A: Run `npx vite-bundle-visualizer` to see what's bloating. Usually it's:
- Unused dependencies
- Large icon libraries
- Heavy animation libraries
Consider lazy loading or replacing with lighter alternatives.

**Q: How do I know if my design is "good enough"?**  
A: Get feedback! Share on r/webdev, Designer News, or with designer friends. Fresh eyes catch issues you miss.

**Q: Should I hire a designer?**  
A: If budget allows ($2-5k), yes. But your foundation is solid - you can get far on your own with the improvements suggested here.

**Q: What if I get rejected?**  
A: Awwwards is competitive. Even rejection provides feedback you can use to improve. Many sites are submitted multiple times before winning.
